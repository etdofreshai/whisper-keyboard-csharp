## Troubleshooting

### No transcription happening

- Check your API key is valid
- Ensure microphone is working and selected in Audio settings
- Try running the Calibration Wizard
- Check Windows microphone permissions

### Text not appearing in target app

- Some apps may block simulated input - try Paste Mode
- Run WhisperKeyboard as Administrator
- Check that the target window is focused

### Hotkeys not working

- Another app may have registered the same hotkey
- Try different key combinations in Settings → Hotkeys
- Restart the application after changing hotkeys

### Picking up background noise

- Run Calibration Wizard in your typical environment
- Increase VAD Threshold in Audio settings
- Use a directional microphone or headset
